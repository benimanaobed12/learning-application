with their basic information like room name,category,students enrolled and room icon
as button to explore room information
painpoint: icon for room category not displayed on room card
next phase:adding chatbot icon for all pages


on tueday,august 5,2025 i embedded ai chatbot for quick assistant in learning activities
painpoint: i used deepseek api for handling request but it is returning this message Sorry, ``there was an error processing your question.``
